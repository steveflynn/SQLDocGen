# SQLDocGen
Generate default documentation sets for MS SQL Server databases using Extended Properties

There is a SQL script which is used to generate a list of documentation properties and default values for database objects.
Currently, the database objects that can be documented are Schemas, tables, views, stored procedures, functions and columns.

A excel workbook is also provided which is a template for generating code for adding, deleting or updating extended properties.

The script and  workbook can be used to quickly provide a comprehensive skeleton set of default documentation.
The Excel workbook can also be used to customise the extended property values (from their defaults), prior to adding or updating the extended properties.
